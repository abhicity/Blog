            <h2>Chinnaswamy Stadium</h2>
            <img src="./image/cs_stadium.jpg" style="width: 100vh; height: 50vh; border: 5px solid #555;">
            <p>The <b>M. Chinnaswamy Stadium</b> (formerly known as the Karnataka State Cricket Association Stadium)
                is
                a
                cricket
                stadium located in Bangalore, Karnataka. Flanked by the picturesque Cubbon Park, Queen's Road,
                Cubbon
                and
                uptown MG Road, this five-decade-old stadium is situated in the heart of the city of Bangalore It
                has a
                seating capacity of 40,000, and regularly hosts Test cricket, One Day Internationals (ODI), Twenty20
                Internationals (T20i) and other First-class cricket matches, as well as musical and cultural events.
                The
                stadium is the home ground of the Karnataka state cricket team and the Indian Premier League
                franchise
                Royal
                Challengers Bangalore. It is owned by the Government of Karnataka and has been leased out to the
                Karnataka
                State Cricket Association (KSCA) for a period of 100 years. <br><br>

                Formerly known as the Karnataka State Cricket Association Stadium, it was later rechristened in
                tribute
                to
                Mangalam Chinnaswamy, a lawyer from Mandya and the founding member of the Mysore State Cricket
                Association. He served the KSCA for four decades and was also president of the Board of Control for
                Cricket in India (BCCI) from 1977–1980. <br><br>

                It is the first cricket stadium in the world to use solar panels to generate a bulk of the
                electricity
                needed to run the stadium. This has been procured as by the "Go Green" initiative of the KSCA.
                <br><br>

                With generous patronage from the Government of Karnataka, the foundation stone of this stadium was
                laid
                in
                1969 and construction work commenced in 1970. The stadium was first used for First-class cricket
                matches
                during the 1972–73 season. It earned test status during the 1974–75 season when the West Indies
                toured
                India.

            <h2>Vidhana Soudha Bengaluru</h2>
            <img src="./image/vidhanasoudha.jpg" style="width: 100vh; height: 50vh; border: 5px solid #555;">
            <p><b>Vidhana Soudha</b> (Legislative House) in Bangalore, India, is the seat of the state legislature of
                Karnataka. It is constructed in a style described as Neo-Dravidian, and incorporates elements of
                various Dravidian styles. Construction was started in 1952 and completed in 1956.<br><br>

                The two houses of legislature of the princely state of Mysore, the legislative assembly and the
                legislative council, were established in 1881 and 1907 respectively. Sessions of the two houses took
                place in Mysore (with joint sessions taking place in the Bangalore Town Hall) until India's independence
                from British rule on 15 August 1947, when Mysore acceded to India. The state's capital was shifted to
                Bangalore; the two houses moved into Attara Kacheri, a British-built building in Cubbon Park that housed
                the High Court of Mysore.<br><br>

                A need was felt for more spacious quarters for the legislature than Attara Kacheri, and in April 1951.
                The foundation stone of the building was laid by Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, on
                13 July 1951. The structure was planned to be a two-storeyed building housing the assembly and
                the council.<br><br>

                Kengal Hanumanthaiah succeeded as Chief Minister after the 1952 election in the state. Calling the
                existing plan a "plain and simple type of American architecture", Hanumanthaiah ordered extensive
                revisions to produce "a work of art in keeping with the tradition of Mysore State". Apart from house
                chambers, the revised plan included government offices, archives, a library and a banquet hall.
                Construction of the building was completed in 1956. Hanumanthiah personally supervised and ordered
                several particular aspects of the construction; one of them was to inscribe "Government Work Is God's
                Work" and its Kannada equivalent on the entablature of the front facade. The final design was meant
                to dwarf the British-built Attara Kacheri, currently the seat of the Karnataka High Court, opposite
                which Vidhana Soudha was being built.<br><br>

                <b>Cost</b>
                Estimates of construction costs for the original two-storied structure stood at 33 lakh (3.3 million)
                rupees. The final cost of construction of the redesigned building was 180 lakh (18 million) rupees.
                Hanumanthaiah was criticised for the inflated sum - equivalent to ₹170 crore, or ₹1.7 billion (US$21
                million) in 2019 - spent on construction.
