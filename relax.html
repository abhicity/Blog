            <h2>Shiva Temple Bengaluru</h2>
            <img src="./image/shiva.jpg" alt="image" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 5px solid #555;">
            <p>The Shivoham Shiva Temple is a temple situated on Old Airport Road, Bangalore, India, dedicated to the
                Hindu deity Lord Shiva. Built in 1995, it features a 65 feet (20m) statue of Shiva. The temple attracts
                an estimated 500,000 worshippers and visitors each year, including between 100,000 and 150,000 on the
                occasion of Maha Shivaratri. <br><br>

                Formerly known as the Shiv Mandir, the temple was consecrated by Sri Shankaracharya of Sringeri on 26
                February 1995. The idol of Lord Shiva was created by the sculptor Kashinath. The temple was renamed as
                the Shivoham Shiva Temple in 2016, when the focus of the temple shifted to helping people attain Moksha
                by understanding the principles in ancient vedic texts.

            <h2>Jai Sharana Basaveshwaraüôè</h2>
            <video class="responsive-video" controls>

            <p>
                <b>Sharana Basaveshwara Temple</b> is an ancient temple located in the ancient town of Gulbarga
                (Kalburgi- the stony land). The temple is dedicated to Shri Sharana Basaveshwara who was an
                eminent teacher, philosopher and a saint in the Hindu religion. <br><br>

                Shri Sharana Basaveshwara was a Lingayath Saint renowned for his Kayak and Dasoha. Dasoha meant
                Charity. According to Lingayath Dasoha meant that one must work hard selflessly and work for the
                society. Whatever belonged to the society must go to the society without any discrimination.
                Kayaka in Lingayath religion meant the removal of inequalities in anything like religion,
                spiritual, social as well as economic.<br><br>

                The temple of Sharana Basveshwara holds the Samadhi of the saint in the garbha gudi. The temple
                has a picturesque lake in the proximity. The overall splendid surrounding enthralls visitors and
                devotes.<br><br>

                The temple has a marvelous structure, which dates to 12th century. The carving contains images
                of garuda, parrots, flowers and elephants. The temple is also known as Sabhamandapa. The temple
                consists of around 36 arches and numerous pillars that add to the beauty of the temple.<br><br>

                The temple is a blend of Mugal as well as Hindu architecture. The temple was constructed almost
                two centuries ago. The panchaloha kalasha which is a combination of five metals can be found
                here. Later during the Mughal empire, the Nizam of Hyderabad conquered the temple. The
                Sabhamantapa and the pradakshinapatha are some marvelous constructions found here. The intricate
                work that is carved out in the pillars and walls are indeed the prominent feature of the temple.
                The entangled serpents sculpture also adds to the elegance of the temple. There is various
                artist‚Äôs depiction of Sri Sharana Basaveshwara on the walls. The interior is lavishly decorated
                with gold and glass mirrors and the roofs are decked up with chandlers which depict the Nizami
                style.<br><br>
